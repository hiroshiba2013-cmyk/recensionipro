/*
  # Fix search function to include user-added businesses with approval_status = 'approved'

  ## Changes
  - Updates the WHERE clause in search_all_business_locations() for unclaimed_business_locations
  - Previously excluded all user-added businesses (added_by IS NOT NULL) unless verification_badge = 'verified'
  - Now also shows user-added businesses where approval_status = 'approved'
  - Pending/rejected user-added businesses remain hidden from search results
